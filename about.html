				<h4>Roma Tihiy  was born July 1993 in Ivano-Frankivsk. Tihiy is a false surname.</h4>
				<p>In the 9th grade in my house there was an ordinary digital girl, for which I was shooting absolutely everything. Subsequently, I got to my father "Zenith". But I really got into the picture when I saw the image appear on the white paper in the bathtub. I continued to remove my friends from time to time, but no more. After graduation I went completely to IT and for a long time I forgot about the photo.</p>
				<p class="mb-0">In the winter of 2017, I took up the camera. Began with the fact that I always took my old mirror with myself. On my way to work I took pictures of the city and people. I began to actively study the topic of street photography and watch the Western photographers.</p>
